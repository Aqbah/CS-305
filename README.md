Overview of the Client and Their Needs
Artemis Financial, a business in the quick-paced financial industry, was the project's client. The security of their REST-based API, which is essential to their IT backbone, was their top priority. In order to safeguard sensitive customer data and guarantee system availability, confidentiality, and integrity, they looked for help detecting and addressing vulnerabilities.

Recognizing Weaknesses
I carried out a comprehensive vulnerability evaluation using static testing and manual code reviews. The absence of HTTPS for secure communication, missing authentication procedures, unencrypted sensitive data, and a lack of input validation were among the main problems found. Outdated dependencies also increased the risk of remote code execution (RCE) and possible denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. I was able to identify these flaws by paying close attention to details and having a thorough understanding of secure coding concepts. To protect sensitive information, uphold confidence, and guarantee business continuity, code security is crucial.

Obstacles and Perspectives
Resolving the several vulnerabilities found by static testing without compromising system functionality was one of the difficulties. This procedure made it clear how crucial it is to strike a balance between preserving operational integrity and enhancing security.

Improvements in Security
I strengthened security layers by enforcing HTTPS protocols, introducing an authentication service, implementing more stringent input validation, and integrating encryption for sensitive data. Performing Maven dependency checks and updating dependencies assisted in mitigating known vulnerabilities. To systematically identify and fix vulnerabilities in the future, I would use tools like OWASP ZAP and implement secure development life cycle (SDLC) techniques.

Providing Security and Functionality
I conducted extra static and dynamic analysis to make sure no new vulnerabilities were discovered after reworking the code, and I utilized unit and integration tests to confirm functioning. The software's dependability and security were guaranteed by this iterative process.

Instruments and Procedures
I adhered to industry standards like OWASP principles and used tools like Maven dependency checks. Achieving the project's objectives required the use of secure coding techniques, such as frequent testing and the least privilege principle. Future projects will benefit greatly from these tools and procedures.

Displaying Capabilities
My ability to recognize, rank, and successfully address software vulnerabilities while preserving system functionality is demonstrated by this project. My contributions to the documentation and refactoring demonstrate my ability to produce dependable, secure software. For prospective employers, this exercise is a powerful portfolio item that highlights my technical and problem-solving abilities.
